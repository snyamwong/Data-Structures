The Cotton Famine in Lancashire from 1861-65 followed the blockade of Confederate Southern ports during the American Civil War which stopped the flow of cotton into mills in Britain. Reports at the time told of starvation, mass unemployment and migration. While the full cause and extent of the Famine in Lancashire are disputed, the consequences of this and the cotton blockade were far reaching.
